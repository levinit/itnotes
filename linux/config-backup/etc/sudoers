## sudoers file.
##
## This file MUST be edited with the 'visudo' command as root.
## Failure to use 'visudo' may result in syntax or file permission errors
## that prevent sudo from running.
##
## See the sudoers man page for the details on how to write a sudoers file.

##
## Host alias specification
##
## Groups of machines. These may include host names (optionally with wildcards),
## IP addresses, network numbers or netgroups.
# Host_Alias	WEBSERVERS = www1, www2, www3

##
## User alias specification
##
## Groups of users.  These may consist of user names, uids, Unix groups,
## or netgroups.
# User_Alias	ADMINS = millert, dowdy, mikef

##
## Cmnd alias specification
##
## Groups of commands.  Often used to group related commands together.
# Cmnd_Alias	PROCESSES = /usr/bin/nice, /bin/kill, /usr/bin/renice, \
# 			    /usr/bin/pkill, /usr/bin/top
#
# Cmnd_Alias	REBOOT = /sbin/halt, /sbin/reboot, /sbin/poweroff
#
# Cmnd_Alias	DEBUGGERS = /usr/bin/gdb, /usr/bin/lldb, /usr/bin/strace, \
# 			    /usr/bin/truss, /usr/bin/bpftrace, \
# 			    /usr/bin/dtrace, /usr/bin/dtruss
#
# Cmnd_Alias	PKGMAN = /usr/bin/apt, /usr/bin/dpkg, /usr/bin/rpm, \
# 			 /usr/bin/yum, /usr/bin/dnf,  /usr/bin/zypper, \
# 			 /usr/bin/pacman

##
## Defaults specification
##
## You may wish to keep some of the following environment variables
## when running commands via sudo.
##
## Locale settings
# Defaults env_keep += "LANG LANGUAGE LINGUAS LC_* _XKB_CHARSET"
##
## Run X applications through sudo; HOME is used to find the
## .Xauthority file.  Note that other programs use HOME to find   
## configuration files and this may lead to privilege escalation!
# Defaults env_keep += "HOME"
##
## X11 resource path settings
# Defaults env_keep += "XAPPLRESDIR XFILESEARCHPATH XUSERFILESEARCHPATH"
##
## Desktop path settings
# Defaults env_keep += "QTDIR KDEDIR"
##
## Allow sudo-run commands to inherit the callers' ConsoleKit session
# Defaults env_keep += "XDG_SESSION_COOKIE"
##
## Uncomment to enable special input methods.  Care should be taken as
## this may allow users to subvert the command being run via sudo.
# Defaults env_keep += "XMODIFIERS GTK_IM_MODULE QT_IM_MODULE QT_IM_SWITCHER"
##
## Uncomment to use a hard-coded PATH instead of the user's to find commands
# Defaults secure_path="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin"
##
## Uncomment to restore the historic behavior where a command is run in
## the user's own terminal.
# Defaults !use_pty
##
## Uncomment to send mail if the user does not enter the correct password.
# Defaults mail_badpass
##
## Uncomment to enable logging of a command's output, except for
## sudoreplay and reboot.  Use sudoreplay to play back logged sessions.
## Sudo will create up to 2,176,782,336 I/O logs before recycling them.
## Set maxseq to a smaller number if you don't have unlimited disk space.
# Defaults log_output
# Defaults!/usr/bin/sudoreplay !log_output
# Defaults!/usr/local/bin/sudoreplay !log_output
# Defaults!REBOOT !log_output
# Defaults maxseq = 1000
##
## Uncomment to disable intercept and log_subcmds for debuggers and
## tracers.  Otherwise, anything that uses ptrace(2) will be unable
## to run under sudo if intercept_type is set to "trace".
# Defaults!DEBUGGERS !intercept, !log_subcmds
##
## Uncomment to disable intercept and log_subcmds for package managers.
## Some package scripts run a huge number of commands, which is made
## slower by these options and also can clutter up the logs.
# Defaults!PKGMAN !intercept, !log_subcmds

##
## Runas alias specification
##

##
## User privilege specification
##
root ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

## Uncomment to allow members of group wheel to execute any command
 %wheel ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

## Same thing without a password
#%wheel      ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
%wheel ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /user/sbin/systemctl,/usr/bin/systemctl,/usr/bin/pacman

## Uncomment to allow members of group sudo to execute any command
# %sudo	ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

## Uncomment to allow any user to run sudo if they know the password
## of the user they are running the command as (root by default).
# Defaults targetpw  # Ask for the password of the target user
# ALL ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL  # WARNING: only use this together with 'Defaults targetpw'

## Read drop-in files from /etc/sudoers.d
@includedir /etc/sudoers.d
